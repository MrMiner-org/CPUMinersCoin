CMC - CPU Miners Coin 
========
![](src/qt/res/icons/cpuminerscoin.png)

The profit of cpu mining is only enough for your electricity bill most of the time, so we hope to change this situation through staking mining. In CMC, 50% of the blocks are allocated to staking mining every day. The most important thing is that staking mining basically does not consume electricity. And your cmc is always in your own wallet.
